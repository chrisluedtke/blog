My [python package](https://pypi.org/project/divvy-data/) allows users to conveniently download and monitor live and historic Chicago bikeshare data. I used this package to conduct my own analysis, culminating in [an animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVueGQPpz14) of the most representative 24 hours of bikeshare activity.
