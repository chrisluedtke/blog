As a [Chicago Python](https://www.chipy.org/) mentee in Spring 2018, I learned a massive amount and got a lot done. In addition to building [a webapp to host a machine learning algorithm](https://github.com/chrisluedtke/ACM-School-Placement), I wrote [a suite of tools](https://github.com/chrisluedtke/cy-automation-library) for my AmeriCorps organization to automate data pipelines between Excel workbooks and Salesforce. This was largely accomplished with python's Selenium and xlwings packages.

My three blog posts received "best of" designation, and I placed 3rd overall at the finale presentations. Find those materials at the link below.
