Using live data from [Chicago Transity Authority](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintracker/), I built a python application that maps train positions to LEDs for any section of track in the system, powered by a Rasberry Pi computer. Using GIS methods, I generated a scaled map of my neighborhood to perfectly fit the LED model. My next steps are to interpolate train positions for a smoother animation.
