I lead a team to implement [simmulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) for greatly improved team placements. Using a Google API and user survey, we balanced team demographics and commute duration - an organizational first. This lead to 200% better commutes and an estimated $360,000 savings each year.
