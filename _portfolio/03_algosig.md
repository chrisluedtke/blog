I co-founded and facilitate a monthly Algorithms & Data Structures meetup on behalf of [Chicago Python Users Group](https://www.chipy.org/). Participants select 1 of 3 code challenges and spend the evening honing their problem solving skills. 

[Join us](https://www.meetup.com/_ChiPy_/) every first Thursday of the month!
