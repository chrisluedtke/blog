As an organizer for the [Chicago Python Users Group](https://www.chipy.org/), I co-facilitate our Algorithms Special Interest Group. Participants select 1 of 3 code challenges and spend the evening honing their problem solving skills. 

[Join us](https://www.meetup.com/_ChiPy_/) every first Thursday of the month!
