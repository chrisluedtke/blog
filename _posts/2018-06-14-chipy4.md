## That's a Wrap!

The [Chicago Python Users Group](https://www.chipy.org/) put on an amazing - and amagingly free - [mentorship](https://chipymentor.org/). With my mentor's help, I placed 3rd overall and took home a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with a free month of DataCamp. Check out my talk below, and find other mentees' talks on the [ChiPy YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT372EAC1orBOSUd2fsA8WA/videos). Or better yet, join us at an upcoming [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/_ChiPy_/).
