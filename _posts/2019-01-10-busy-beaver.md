## Building Open Source

The [Chicago Python Users Group](https://www.chipy.org/) has tremendous community investment in Slack. Each month our 4,000 members squeeze every ounce of value from Slack's free tier offerings, pushing the platform to its limits. Fellow ChiPy organizer, [Aly Sivji](https://github.com/alysivji), and I identified the opportunity to circumvent these limitations with Python, and even add valuable community features.

Enter Busy Beaver, an open source Slack bot to increase member engagement and raise awareness of community projects. Our talk below introduces Busy Beaver, provides a high-level walkthrough of its architecture and code, and presents the future roadmap of the project.

Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/busy-beaver-dev/busy-beaver) for details on contributing.
